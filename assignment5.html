                    For the first part of combining two meshes, I started off with the following two meshes from
                    Thingiverse:
                    <br />
                    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2120591/files">Phone stand</a>
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment5/phone_stand.png" width="400px" />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5566927/files">Computer stand</a>
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment5/hand_stand.png" width="400px" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    2
                </span>
                <div>
                    Unfortunately, after a long time struggling with getting the meshes to combine into a single good
                    mesh, I realized the phone stand was a bad mesh to start with. Instead of trying to fix that mesh, I
                    found this headphone stand to work with instead:
                    <br />
                    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2050885/files">Headphone stand</a>
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment5/headphone_stand.png" width="400px" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    3
                </span>
                <div>
                    This worked a lot better! I was able to first position the hand up against the headphone stand in
                    the position I wanted, then slowly trimmed away the points and edges from the hand that I didn't
                    need.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    4
                </span>
                <div>
                    I was able to trim the hands using the headphone stand mesh to get the fit perfect. Then I moved the
                    hands slightly into the mesh, did a boolean mesh union, and a quad remesh. Finally this resulted in
                    a closed mesh which Rhino considered a "good mesh" so I counted it as a win!
                    <img src="assets/assignment5/rhino_models.png" width="800px" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    5
                </span>
                <div>
                    Finally, I imported to Cura and sliced it to make sure the print would work well.
                    <img src="assets/assignment5/cura_slice.png" width="800px" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    6
                </span>
                <div>
                    Moving onto the next phase, I started working on my lamp mesh. I decided I wanted to make a replica
                    of my face on a hanging lamp?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I started off with this terrifying drawing:
                    <img src="assets/assignment5/lamp.png" width="500px" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    7
                </span>
                <div>
                    Then, I used the iOS app Polycam to scan my head, and after a few very bad attempts, I came up with one
                    that was almost good.
                    <br />
                    <video width="800" controls>
                        <source src="assets/assignment5/polycam_model.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Browser does not support video
                    </video>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Which resulted in the following STL:
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment5/polycam_stl.png" width="800px" />


                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    8
                </span>
                <div>
                    Finally, I cleaned up the mesh with deleting/trimming points and remeshing, mirrored the face to
                    complete a shape, and added a top and bottom. I trimmed the top with a 27mm round hole so that the
                    plug can fit through but not the rest of the housing.
