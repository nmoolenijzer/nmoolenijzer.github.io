                    I started with a photo of one of my plants that I wanted to REANIMATE ... er recreate with cardboard.
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment1/leaf.jpg" width="300px" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section-separator"></div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    2
                </span>
                <div>
                    Then I cut out the single leaf in Photoshop and used a threshold to get rid of irregularities due to
                    the color.
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment1/leafcutout.jpg" width="300px" />
                    <img src="assets/assignment1/leafcutout2.jpg" width="300px" />
                    <br /><br />
                    After that I converted the object to a vector in Illustrator and had a happy leaf to use in Rhino.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment1/leafoutline.jpg" width="125px" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section-separator"></div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    3
                </span>
                <div>
                    I pulled the leaf from Illustrator into Rhino and cleaned up the vectors by deleting some busy
                    points and using the rebuild function to remove a lot of the unnecessary points and to smooth curves out.
                    <br /><br />
                    Then, I measured my cardboard to be 5.77mm thick, so I added some 5.77mm wide rectangles,
                    positioned them on the leaves, and started using splits and joins to make them into notches.
                    <br /><br />
                    Finally, I added some basic base structure and "vine" pieces as well so that a full little plant
                    could be created. I used array linear to duplicate the outlines, and here we are! Ready to try out
                    once the machines are back online.

                    Unfortunately, the laser cutter was down during times where I could come into the MILL, so I will be
                    continuing my journey next week!
