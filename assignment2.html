                <div>
                    I started with some inspiration from <a href="https://parametrichouse.com/wallart1/">Parametric
                        House</a><br />
                    <img src="https://parametrichouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/laser-cutting-design-1-5-2019-200003.jpg"
                        width="500px" />
                    <br />But unfortunately they didn't have much in the way of instructions or tutorials, so I had to
                    figure things out on my own!
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    2
                </span>
                <div>
                    I started out with the base, which I knew would be relatively straight forward. I wanted to make 3
                    panels that had a certain number of notches that depended on the length of the desired piece and the
                    notch size (i.e., cardboard thickness)
                    The result was this parametric design. Using my specifications of a 15in piece with cardboard
                    thickness of 0.17in, this is the output of the Grasshopper calculation:
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment2/base.png" width="400px" />
                    <br /><br />
                    After that I got started on the panels that would be put into the notches.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    3
                </span>
                <div>
                    The first thing I tackled was the morphed surface that I would use to trim the plain rectangle
                    panels. I knew this would be the most difficult part, but luckily I found this tutorial on YouTube
                    for how to make such a surface:
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKXFKjI-piA">How to make random wavy surface in Rhino
                        Grasshopper</a>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I followed this tutorial to make the parametric random surface. I started with a plain rectangle
                    that had an arbitrary width and the same length as the panels in step 2 so that they would match up.
                    Then I divided the surface by a parametric value (in this case 5) into a grid of points. Using that
                    list of points and the random number generator, I created some amplitude vectors to move the points
                    in random up and down directions.
                    Then I used the surface from points function to create a new surface using these randomly
                    distributed points! This is what I ended up with:
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment2/wavy_surface.png" width="400px" />

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    4
                </span>
                <div>
                    With the tutorial done, I could get back to business! I created the basic board shape that I would
                    use to intersect with the surface created in step 3. I used the linear array functionality to create
                    copies that matched up with the length of the wavy surface (and consequently, the length of the
                    panels in step 2).
                    Then I extruded the wavy surface and used it to trim the boards and I used the boards to trim the
                    wavy surface, then joined the curves to create outlines.
                    Then I added the 3 notches which would connect to the panels from step 2 and used linear array on
                    those as well, then did the same intersect/join process on them.
                    <br />
                    <img src="assets/assignment2/intersection.png" width="400px" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <span class="numbers">
                    5
                </span>
                <div>
                    Finally, the most difficult part was getting them all back on one plane and distributed evenly.
                    Unfortunately I could not find a way to do this in Grasshopper, but I did realize I could bake them
                    on top of each other and distribute in Rhino, so I did that instead!
                    <br /><br />
                    Ultimately, my Grasshopper file ended up very complicated, but here's a high level snapshot of what
                    each section contains!

                    6
                </span>
                <div>
                    With all of that done, I exported to Illustrator, arranged nicely, and headed to the laser cutter!
                    My laser cutter
                    settings were 50% power and 25% speed, on vector cut.

                <div>

                    Finally I assembled!<br />
